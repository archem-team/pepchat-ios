# Cursor Rules for PepChat iOS

## File Size Guidelines
- **Maximum file length: 300 lines of code**
- When a file exceeds 300 lines, it should be refactored and split into smaller, more focused files
- Break down large files by:
  - Extracting related functionality into separate files
  - Moving extensions to dedicated extension files
  - Splitting large view controllers/view models into smaller components
  - Separating concerns into logical modules

## Code Organization
- Keep files focused on a single responsibility
- Use extensions to organize related functionality when appropriate
- Prefer composition over large monolithic files
- When adding new files, edit the xcode project file to include them


## Build
- use this command to run build: xcodebuild -scheme Revolt -destination 'id=00008020-001E61EC3AB8003A' build
